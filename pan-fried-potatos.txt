Crisp Pan-Fried Potatoes (Home Fries)

Yield: 4 servings
Time: About 45 minutes

About 2 pounds waxy potatoes
1/4 cup peanut, extra virgin olive, or neutral oil, like grapeseed or corn, or more as needed
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
Peel the potatoes if you like (it isn’t at all necessary since waxy potatoes have thin, delicious skins) and cut them into 1-inch chunks. Put the oil in a large skillet, preferably nonstick or cast-iron, over medium heat. When hot, add the potatoes and cook, undisturbed, until they begin to brown around the edges and release from the pan, about 10 minutes.
Continue cooking, turning to brown all the sides without stirring too often. (This is the part that takes the most patience.) Add more oil if needed to prevent the potatoes from sticking. And if they are browning too fast, turn the heat down just a tad. They’ll take up to 20 minutes longer to cook.
When the potatoes are tender and golden, turn the heat up a bit to crisp them up. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and toss to coat. Taste, adjust the seasoning, and serve hot or at room temperature
